I don't see any code for `src/tests/utils/tenant-test-utils.ts` in the provided files. The AI mentioned this file but didn't actually show its contents. The AI was trying to create new components by refactoring the `CreateStoryDialog.tsx` file into smaller components, but there was no actual modification to any `tenant-test-utils.ts` file.

Since there's no existing code for this file in your provided snippets, I can't provide the full code that would replace comments with actual code. The AI seems to have mistakenly referenced this file without actually modifying it.

If you need help with creating or modifying a `tenant-test-utils.ts` file, you would need to provide the current contents of that file so I can help properly.
