# Content Engine Standardization Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implementing the codebase standardization recommendations.

## Phase 1: Status and Type Standardization

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create centralized status types in `src/types/status.ts`
2. ✅ Create status utility functions for UI components
3. ✅ Update existing components to use the new status utilities
4. ✅ Update backend API to ensure consistent status values
5. ✅ Add validation for status transitions

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week (✅ Completed)

## Phase 2: Component Consolidation

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create shared card components
2. ✅ Create shared badge components
3. ✅ Refactor idea list views to use shared components
4. ☐ Refactor draft list views to use shared components
5. ☐ Refactor document list views to use shared components
6. ☐ Add Storybook documentation for shared components

### Estimated Timeline: 2 weeks (In Progress)

## Phase 3: Data Model Alignment

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create model factory functions
2. ✅ Document database schema and frontend model alignment
3. ✅ Fixed WritingStyleProfile type definition consistency
4. ✅ Implemented consistent model handling in WritingStyle hooks
5. ☐ Create database migration scripts
6. ☐ Update API response processing to use consistent models
7. ☐ Add validation for model integrity

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week (Partially Complete)

## Phase 4: API Standardization

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create standardized API hooks
2. ✅ Fixed page reload issues with WritingStylePage
3. ☐ Update remaining API calls to use standardized hooks
4. ☐ Add error handling and retry logic
5. ☐ Add caching and optimistic updates

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week (Partially Complete)

## Phase 5: Dead Code Removal

### Tasks:
1. ☐ Identify unused components
2. ☐ Identify unused utility functions
3. ☐ Identify unused API calls
4. ☐ Remove unused code
5. ☐ Update tests

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Phase 6: Testing and Documentation

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create codebase standards documentation
2. ✅ Updated and fixed WritingStyle tests
3. ☐ Update component documentation
4. ☐ Add tests for new shared components
5. ☐ Add tests for utility functions
6. ☐ Add tests for API hooks

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Implementation Approach

For each phase:

1. **Start with low-risk changes** - Focus on utility functions and isolated components first
2. **Create new components alongside existing ones** - Incrementally replace old components
3. **Test thoroughly before removing old code** - Ensure functionality is preserved
4. **Update documentation as you go** - Keep the standards document current

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes:
- Creating utility functions
- Creating new shared components
- Updating documentation

### Medium Risk Changes:
- Refactoring existing components
- Updating API hooks
- Adding validation

### High Risk Changes:
- Database schema changes
- Removing existing components
- Changing status transition logic

## Success Criteria

The standardization effort will be successful when:

1. All status values are consistently defined and used
2. UI components use shared, reusable patterns
3. Data models are consistent across frontend and backend
4. API calls follow a standardized pattern
5. No unused code remains
6. Documentation is comprehensive and current
7. All tests pass

## Review Process

After each phase:

1. Code review by at least two team members
2. Functionality testing in development environment
3. Update to implementation plan based on lessons learned

## Recent Progress (Last Updated: Current Date)

1. ✅ Completed Phase 1: Status and Type Standardization
2. ✅ Created status validation utilities with proper transition rules
3. ✅ Implemented status service API for consistent status updates
4. ✅ Fixed status component imports to use centralized types
5. ✅ Fixed WritingStyleProfile type consistency issues
6. ✅ Added proper data refetching to WritingStylePage
7. ✅ Ensured both camelCase and snake_case property support in WritingStyle hooks
8. ✅ Created shared IdeaContentCard component for idea list views
9. ✅ Refactored IdeasTab and IdeasList to use shared components
10. ✅ Updated RecentIdeasCard to use shared components

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2: Component Consolidation
   - Refactor draft list views to use shared components
   - Create consistent draft card components for content pipelines
   
2. Progress on Phase 3: Data Model Alignment
   - Standardize response processing from API calls
   - Add validation for model integrity
   
3. Progress on Phase 4: API Standardization
   - Update remaining API calls to use standardized hooks
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns

4. Begin planning for Phase 5: Dead Code Removal
   - Create an inventory of potentially unused components
   - Develop a strategy for safely removing deprecated code
