# Content Engine Standardization Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implementing the codebase standardization recommendations.

## Phase 1: Status and Type Standardization

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create centralized status types in `src/types/status.ts`
2. ✅ Create status utility functions for UI components
3. ✅ Update existing components to use the new status utilities
4. ✅ Update backend API to ensure consistent status values
5. ✅ Add validation for status transitions

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week (✅ Completed)

## Phase 2: Component Consolidation

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create shared card components
2. ✅ Create shared badge components
3. ☐ Refactor idea list views to use shared components
4. ☐ Refactor draft list views to use shared components
5. ☐ Refactor document list views to use shared components
6. ☐ Add Storybook documentation for shared components

### Estimated Timeline: 2 weeks

## Phase 3: Data Model Alignment

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create model factory functions
2. ✅ Document database schema and frontend model alignment
3. ✅ Fixed WritingStyleProfile type definition consistency
4. ✅ Implemented consistent model handling in WritingStyle hooks
5. ☐ Create database migration scripts
6. ☐ Update API response processing to use consistent models
7. ☐ Add validation for model integrity

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Phase 4: API Standardization

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create standardized API hooks
2. ✅ Fixed page reload issues with WritingStylePage
3. ☐ Update remaining API calls to use standardized hooks
4. ☐ Add error handling and retry logic
5. ☐ Add caching and optimistic updates

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Phase 5: Dead Code Removal

### Tasks:
1. ☐ Identify unused components
2. ☐ Identify unused utility functions
3. ☐ Identify unused API calls
4. ☐ Remove unused code
5. ☐ Update tests

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Phase 6: Testing and Documentation

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create codebase standards documentation
2. ✅ Updated and fixed WritingStyle tests
3. ☐ Update component documentation
4. ☐ Add tests for new shared components
5. ☐ Add tests for utility functions
6. ☐ Add tests for API hooks

### Estimated Timeline: 1 week

## Implementation Approach

For each phase:

1. **Start with low-risk changes** - Focus on utility functions and isolated components first
2. **Create new components alongside existing ones** - Incrementally replace old components
3. **Test thoroughly before removing old code** - Ensure functionality is preserved
4. **Update documentation as you go** - Keep the standards document current

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes:
- Creating utility functions
- Creating new shared components
- Updating documentation

### Medium Risk Changes:
- Refactoring existing components
- Updating API hooks
- Adding validation

### High Risk Changes:
- Database schema changes
- Removing existing components
- Changing status transition logic

## Success Criteria

The standardization effort will be successful when:

1. All status values are consistently defined and used
2. UI components use shared, reusable patterns
3. Data models are consistent across frontend and backend
4. API calls follow a standardized pattern
5. No unused code remains
6. Documentation is comprehensive and current
7. All tests pass

## Review Process

After each phase:

1. Code review by at least two team members
2. Functionality testing in development environment
3. Update to implementation plan based on lessons learned

## Recent Progress (Last Updated: Current Date)

1. Fixed WritingStyleProfile type definitions to properly handle both snake_case and camelCase properties
2. Updated WritingStyle hooks to handle data transformation consistently
3. Eliminated page reload on WritingStylePage save action
4. Added proper refetch mechanism after saving writing style
5. Added status validation utilities to ensure consistent status transitions
6. Created standardized status service API for updating content statuses
7. Updated components to use status validation when changing status

## Next Steps

1. Move to Phase 2: Component Consolidation
2. Continue with API standardization by refactoring remaining API hooks
3. Begin addressing inconsistent naming patterns across components
4. Focus on optimistic updates to improve user experience
5. Consider implementing a more robust form state management approach
